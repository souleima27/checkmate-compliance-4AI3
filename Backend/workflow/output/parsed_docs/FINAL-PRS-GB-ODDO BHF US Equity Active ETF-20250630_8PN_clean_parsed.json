Article 6: The management team does not consider sustainability risks or adverse effects of investment decisions on sustainability factors in the investment decision making process. Article 8: The management team addresses sustainability risks by integrating ESG criteria (Environment and/or Social and/or Governance) into its investment decision making process. Article 9: The management team follows a strict sustainable investment objective that significantly contributes to the challenges of the ecological transition, and addresses Sustainability Risks through ratings provided by the Management Company’s external ESG data provider. | 2 The summary risk indicator (SRI) is a guide to the level of risk of this product compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product will lose money because of movements in the markets or because we are not able to pay you. It scales in a range from 1 (lowest risk) to 7 (highest risk). The lowest category does not mean a risk-free investment. This indicator is not constant and is updated if the risk profile of the fund changes over time. Historical data, such as is used to calculate the risk indicator, may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. There is no guarantee that the management objectives in terms of risk will actually be met. The risk indicator assumes you keep the product until the end of the recommended holding period. The actual risk can vary ! significantly if you cash in at an early stage and you may get back less."

A higher active share implies a greater difference in portfolio allocation vs the benchmark.\nJensen’s alpha \nMeasure of the performance gap between the portfolio and the benchmark with a similar level of risk (adjusted for β). It measures the value of the fund or the manager’s ability to “beat the market”, also known as excess return.\nBeta \nβ measures the sensitivity of the performance of a portfolio compared with that of its benchmark, i.e., when the bench- mark varies by X%, the fund varies, on average, by a magnitude equal to β*X%."

Duration is expressed as the weighted average life of all flows (interest and principal).\nDistance to bond floor \nFor convertible bonds, the value of the bond component.

It is the difference between the annualised performance of the fund (or its benchmark) and the annual return based on the risk-free rate divided by the volatility of the fund (or its benchmark).\nInformation ratio \nThe information ratio measures the over/under performance achieved by the manager when he or she deviates from the reference indicator It is equal to the difference in the annualized portfolio return by relative to its reference indicator, divided by the tracking error. \nRecovery Delay \nPayback period of maximum drawdown: the time to clear the loss on the worst period of decline and return to the original level."

The value of the portfolio is subject to change in the event of deterioration or improvement in the quality of issuers. Thus, a value of +2% for instance means that for an instantaneous 1% increase (respectively decrease) in spreads, the portfolio value would decrease (in- crease) by 2%.\nInterest rate sensitivity \nFor convertible bonds, interest rate sensitivity measures the percentage change in value induced by a change in the interest rate."
