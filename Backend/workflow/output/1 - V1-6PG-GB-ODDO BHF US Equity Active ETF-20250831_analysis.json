            "text": "1 The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) is a set of EU rules which aim to make the sustainability profile of funds transparent, more comparable and better understood by end investors. Article 6: The management team does not consider sustainability risks or adverse effects of investment decisions on sustainability factors in the investment decision making process. Article 8: The management team addresses sustainability risks by integrating ESG criteria (Environment and/or Social and/or Governance) into its investment decision making process. Article 9: The management team follows a strict sustainable investment objective that significantly contributes to the challenges of the ecological transition, and addresses Sustainability Risks through ratings provided by the Management Company’s external ESG data provider. | 2 The summary risk indicator (SRI) is a guide to the level of risk of this product compared to other products. It shows how likely it is that the product will lose money because of movements in the markets or because we are not able to pay you. It scales in a range from 1 (lowest risk) to 7 (highest risk). The lowest category does not mean a risk-free investment. This indicator is not constant and is updated if the risk profile of the fund changes over time. Historical data, such as is used to calculate the risk indicator, may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund. There is no guarantee that the management objectives in terms of risk will actually be met. The risk indicator assumes you keep the product until the end of the recommended holding period. The actual risk can vary ! significantly if you cash in at an early stage and you may get back less.\nSource: ODDO BHF AM | Data as of 31/08/2025"
